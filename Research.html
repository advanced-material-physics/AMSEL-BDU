    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Our research focuses on advanced materials for solar energy applications. 
      From polymers and molecules to nanostructured materials, we investigate 
      fundamental and applied aspects that drive innovation in next-generation photovoltaics.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="polymer-molecules">
    <h2>Polymers and Molecules</h2>
    <p>
      Research in polymeric and molecular systems is directed toward the design and 
      synthesis of new organic semiconductors. These materials enable lightweight, 
      flexible, and cost-effective solar devices.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="stability">
    <h2>Environmental Stability of PV</h2>
    <p>
      Stability is one of the main challenges for real-world deployment of solar technologies. 
      Our work addresses degradation mechanisms caused by moisture, oxygen, temperature, 
      and UV light.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="thinfilms">
    <h2>Thin Films, Surface and Interface</h2>
    <p>
      Interfaces play a critical role in charge transport and recombination. 
      We investigate thin-film growth, interfacial chemistry, and surface engineering 
      to enhance device efficiency and longevity.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="solarcell">
    <h2>Emerging Solar Cells</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond conventional silicon photovoltaics, we study emerging solar cell 
      architectures such as perovskite, tandem, and organic-inorganic hybrid systems.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="nano">
    <h2>Nanoparticles and Plasmonics</h2>
    <p>
      Nanostructured materials and plasmonic effects are explored to improve light 
      absorption, charge separation, and overall solar device performance.
